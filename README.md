This project is a gui that allows a user to interact with a Binaray Search Tree through the creation of it and the traversing the created tree.

Project utilizes:
- Recursion
- HashTable and LinkedHashMap
- Threads and Concurrency 
- GUI
- Creation of Nodes and Binary Search Tree
- HTML

The point of the project is to help a user learn how a Binary Search Tree is created.  A Binary Search Tree meaning that a node contains data (in this case numbers) which is branched off into up to two other nodes with the nodes to the left being less in value and to the right higher in value.  The user watches as the data they add is brought to the correct location of the tree and a new node is added.  They also watch as the node they are attempting to remove is found by utilizing the order feature of a tree.
